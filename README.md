# You-ve-got-mail

## Description 

Solution ESP32 micro-controller and IR obstacle detection sensor to notify user when a mail is received in the mailbox

The user will receive a text notification and an email when a new mail is received

## Motivation

I was being lazy enough to check my mailbox at the front everyday
So I tried to over engineer a solution to avoid doing that.

Uses Ubidots platform to send text and email and ESP32 operates over wifi ntwrk.
